# Hospital-Website
Hospital Webpage is a static yet interactive webpage designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The HTML page has been externally linked with the CSS styling page and internally connected with JS using <script> tag.

Firstly, the page contains a header. On clicking the header, a form menu appears just below it. Then there is a navigation bar and a dropdown menu along with the logo of the hospital.

Below is the “About Us” section with information about the hospital and a youtube video of “Advancement in the Field of Medical Sciences”.

There is also a sticky Emergency button at the left-center of the page. Clicking on it opens another webpage/website which has all the emergency numbers.

There is a form to be filled out by the user so that the client can get an appointment with the doctor. 

Below the form, lies an interactive footer. The footer has a dedicated gradient background and multiple links present for the user's benefit. Hovering a link creates a colour effect.
